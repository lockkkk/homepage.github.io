## About me

Hi, I'm Jiaxin. I'm currently a undergraduate student in Beijing, China. Specifically, I am interested in high-level, symbolic processes of **image recognition** and interpretation that accurately model the way people interact with the world.

Besides, I also dive into the field of **networking** and **system**, now I am a research intern in the Network Research group of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). My CV is available on the right side (updated Dec 2018).

Additionly, I love digital painting, you can see my work in [My art work](#my-artwork)  :)

## My Project

### Free Virtual Piano System
1. General goal:
- translate hand movement on paper with printed piano keys to music. 

2. Demo: 
```diff
- Please play with high volume

### Mono 3D Detection -part 1-
1. General goal:
- Combining neural networkâ€™s estimates with geometric constraints provided by a 2D object bounding box to produce a complete 3D bounding box. 

2. Structure:

### Mono 3D Detection -part 2-
1. General goal:
- Padding image to get out boundary 2D box, to solve truncation problem.
- Using re-projection error to realize bundle adjustment in training loss. Realize end-to-end training.

2. Structure:

### Semiautomatic annotation
1. General goal:
- Use CAD models to generate key-point label on real images in KITTI dataset for future network training.
- Generate visible type for each labeled point.

2. Sample:

### Bird-view lane detection
1. General goal:
- Using vanishing point to adaptively transform image into bird view.
- Detecting lane lines in bird view using FCN-based neural network architecture.
- Tracking the lane lines by semi-dense direct visual odometry and Kalman Filter.

2. Demo:
