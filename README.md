## About me

Hi, I'm Jiaxin. I'm currently an undergraduate student in Beijing, China. Specifically, I am interested in high-level, symbolic processes of **image recognition** and interpretation that accurately model the way people interact with the world.

Besides, I also dive into the field of **networking** and **system**, now I am a research intern in the Network Research group of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). My CV is available on the left side. 



Additionly, I love digital painting, you can see my work in [My art work](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOVooov5Zav8ADyYoYuFBqVz4_sWCLplyxZyXAuT9sFbsXajnxg6QTqWDu78W_3dw?key=X1d1X0RjSTZxdjJUcWJNTzBsaW9BZGRPb1JNMzBn)  :)

## My Project

### Free Virtual Piano System
- Translate hands movement on paper with printed piano keys to music. [Detail](/pages/Page_1.md)

<img src="src/System_structure.png" width="50%" />

```diff
- Please play with high volume
```

### Mono 3D Detection
- Combine neural network’s estimates with geometric constraints provided by a 2D object bounding box to produce a complete 3D bounding box. [Detail](/pages/Page_2.md)

![Geometry](src/result_2.png)



### Semiautomatic annotation
- Work on semiautomatic annotation. Use CAD models to generate 2D point coordinates on real images in KITTI dataset.
- [Detail](/pages/Page_3.md)

### Bird-view lane detection
- Using vanishing point to adaptively transform image into bird view.
- Detecting lane lines in bird view using FCN-based neural network architecture.
- Tracking the lane lines by semi-dense direct visual odometry and Kalman Filter.

### Glane-On-CPU
- Project in Network Research Group, Microsoft Research Asia
- Design and implementation of Glane Communication Stack, a coordinator in Terminus which communicates with CPU and FPGA. Aiming to accelerate data preprocessing in machine learning.
- Glane Streaming NIC Stack design and implementation. We advocate a new hardware solution, Direct Connect NIC, specific for streaming communication. Aiming to solve RDMA’s inefficient API support and poor scalability problem in streaming communication. (Ongoing).
