## About me

Hi, I'm Jiaxin. I'm currently a undergraduate student in Beijing, China. Specifically, I am interested in high-level, symbolic processes of **image recognition** and interpretation that accurately model the way people interact with the world.

Besides, I also dive into the field of **networking** and **system**, now I am a research intern in the Network Research group of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). My CV is available on the right side (updated Dec 2018).

Additionly, I love digital painting, you can see my work in [My art work](#my-artwork)  :)
